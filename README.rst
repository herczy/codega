What is codega?
----

codega is a code-generator which creates C/C++/Python/etc. code from an XML file. The XML file can
be used to specify structures (among other things) in the protocol.

What stage is it in?
----

It's in the very beginning. It doesn't do much yet beyond parsing a few rudimentary node types and
dumping them. It can be tried out:

    $ ./cgmake -c examples/basic/codega.xml

Where can I find it?
----

codega can be found at
