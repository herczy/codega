What is codega?
----

codega is a code-generator framework for creating C/C++/Python/etc. code from an XML source. This XML file
source can have any format desired if the appropriate generator is written.

What stage is it in?
----

It's in the beginning. At this point it's unstable, many features get added or removed on a whim (but after proper
planning, of course :) ) It doesn't do much yet beyond providing a framework and having a few examples. You can
try it out:

    $ ./cgx make -c examples/basic/codega.xml

Where can I find it?

codega can be found at
